# Fine-tuning Text-to-Speech (TTS) Models for English Technical Speech and Regional Languages

## Project Overview
This repository contains the solution for fine-tuning two Text-to-Speech (TTS) models. The project focuses on improving TTS model performance in two domains:
1. English technical speech (with a focus on technical jargon commonly used in interviews).
2. A regional language of your choice.

Additionally, optimization techniques such as quantization are explored to improve inference speed and reduce model size without significantly compromising audio quality.


## Objectives
The key objectives of this project are:
1. **Fine-tune a TTS model for English technical terms**: Enhance the model's pronunciation of commonly used technical terms like "API," "CUDA,".
2. **Fine-tune a TTS model for a regional language**: Improve the model's ability to synthesize high-quality, natural-sounding speech in a regional language.
3. **Optimize model for fast inference**: Apply quantization techniques to speed up inference while maintaining output quality.
